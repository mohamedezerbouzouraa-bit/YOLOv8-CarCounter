# YOLOv8-CarCounter

🚗 YOLOv8-CarCounter

YOLOv8-CarCounter is a lightweight and modular car detection project built with Python and Ultralytics YOLOv8. It allows users to upload images, automatically detect and count cars, and visualize results with bounding boxes — all with minimal setup.

Designed for Google Colab and easy local execution, this project is ideal for learning, experimentation, and extension into larger computer vision pipelines.
